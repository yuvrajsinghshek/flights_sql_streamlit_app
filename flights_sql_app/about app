This is data from a "past date", used only for building a project that can demonstrate my work.
It will not provide any information about future flights.


We are creating a website based on flight data, which will include a sidebar titled "Flight Analytics",
and a dropdown box named "Menu". The dropdown will have three options:

1. Check Flights
2. Analytics
3. About Project â€“ which will contain a description of this project.

-> Inside the "Check Flights" section, we will keep three dropdown toggles:

1. The first one for selecting the "Source" (departure city),
2. The second for the "Destination" city, and
3. The third for the "Date" (based on available data).

After selecting all three, we will click on "Search" button,
and all the flights available on that selected day will be displayed.


-> Inside the "Analytics" section, we will make analysis of the project
